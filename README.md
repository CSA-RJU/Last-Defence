# Last-Defence
This is a space game I made for school originally called Star Battles, with the new update came a name change. 
The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible before the time runs out. Any score 0 or below is considered a loss, 
and a score above that counts as a win. Right now the time limit is short for show, but in the final version it will be extended.

*UPDATE*:

So, what I have added since the last time is that I have made a much more advanced GUI. The game generally looks much better, 
especially the title screen. I have changed the image for the ship, and I already have the rest done. Those should be included 
in the pack already. I added a limit to the rate of fire, the better the shot, the longer the wait. I balanced the game to the best of my 
ability. Fixed some hit boxes, the speed of the ship. I even added two more power ups! 

Also, I removed the fortnite galaxy skin from the game...

Also, there is a power up indicator, with an icon! I'm just very proud of that okay? Also, the time counts down in seconds now instead of frames. 
Please let me know if I left anything crucial out of the zip file.

*UPDATE*:

I believe I the biggest change is the GUI. I have made a sort of theme with the GUI and I have even added a health bar and Fuel bar. 
I have also reduced lag significantly, even bigger fix coming soon. I have added a button to reset high scores if you want to, 
just keep in mind it will be an admin privilege later. I have made every ship sprite, but I haven't added them all. I have, however, 
replaced the old ship with a red one. Right now, I have four ship sprites. I will still be working on the GUI for just a bit longer, 
but hopefully not too long. I already have several easter egg Ideas for the game, one is already there and it is just rare. 
Most others will be unlock-able ships.

So... The main thing that you need to know here is that I have decided to go in a different direction. 
I want to keep the focus on the game's replay-ability factor, look, and general feel. What I mean by that is that I want this to be 
a game that people could go through pretty quickly and yet play again over and over. This means that the game will have to have 
a nice, visually appealing look, to keep people interested. That's why I have spent so much time on graphics. 
It also means that the menu is straight to the point, every thing is right there. The player can just get right back into the action 
when they die, and still see their scores. The only reason a player should have to sop and click is when they are checking how to play 
which they will need to slowdown for anyway. That's why the key to start the game is "P" and also the same as pause. 
The player's hand should automatically rest there when playing because of the key configuration I have. This allows them to just jump 
right into the action with no hesitation once they get used to the game.

So as far as my timeline, like I said, there are several things I want to remain the same, and several things I want to add. 
I have spent far more time than intended on the game's look. However, I have come to be very proud of it. I will still be adding 
another ship, however, it is a secret. I will say that it will add a whole new fun factor to the game. There will also be 
a secret power up to be accessed by a secret code withing the game, I will probably reveal that to you later on. There are still 
so many things I want to add to the game, and maybe I will get to those after the Alpha. For now I need to focus on a few things 
I said I would add. Somethings I plan on doing before the development on the game is done are: to make fire come from the ship and 
increase size when moving faster. To make the asteroids blow up properly, and change the control of the game (make it move much less 
stiffly.

Also, to clarify, I think I will just stick with one ship for now, with a secret unlock-able ship, or at least upgrade. This is 
not so much because it would be to hard, or necessarily that it would take too long. It is just because I want to maintain 
a certain play style for the game. I have put a lot of work into making the game balanced, visually appealing, and generally 
not boring (I hope and think). There are so many little details that you might not even notice your first time playing. 
For example: the stars moving along as that student pointed out. When you are out of a power up, the counter darkens color, 
power up indicator as well as the shield blinks to indicate that you are running low. All of these tiny details that are 
hardly noticeable, but are so vital to the games overall feel.. I know this game will be one one the computer outside the classroom, 
and people don't have too much time to play, so somebody could just be in and out of a game within a minute, and come back later to 
beat their high score. Believe me, no detail in this game came accidentally, every thing has a purpose, and I have worked 
in much detail to make it that way. I hope you will like the feel of the finished game.

*UPDATE*:

I ADDED A SHIP CHANGING SCREEN! Now the player can customize their ship at any time while playing the game. I was even able to make 
one of the ships unlock-able. The ships don't do anything special as of yet, so they are purely cosmetic, but, later on, they should have unique properties and abilities. The special ship is a secret, you will just have to get 7500 points to see it, better yet, what it does when I add that functionality, which shouldn't take all of too long. In the final commit (v.1) I will probably have the player start with one ship, if I have time, and work their way up. Speaking of points, the player now gets 200 points instead of 100 every asteroid hit. Also mentioning points, random people can no longer reset the scores, they must input a special code.

In the end I was able to sneak in a few easter eggs, not quite as I imagined, but not bad. Oh yeah! speaking of which, I have added 
accessories to the game, these are and are planned to continue being purely cosmetic. For example, the MLG glasses turn big lasers into 
Doritos. The one thing I have had the biggest trouble with overall is fixing the lag, Just now before writing this, I was able to add 
what I think was a complete lag fix. I can't be totally sure, though, my computer has never really shown it in the first place. I will 
just have to see how it runs on somebody else's. I say I think for the fix because, the lag has noticeably disappeared from what I can 
tell, however, I have not been able to run sufficient tests, so it is possible that there are a few new appearing bugs that I will 
need to double check, I have patched the ones I could see right off the bat, but I'm not sure how well. Only time will tell.
